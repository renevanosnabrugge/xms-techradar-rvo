"Azure Deployment Environments","DevOps","Investigate","TRUE","Azure Deployment Environments is a service that allows development teams to create and manage isolated environments for application development, testing, and production. These environments are provisioned using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates, ensuring consistency and reducing configuration drift. It simplifies deployment workflows by enabling self-service environment creation while maintaining control through policies, quotas, and governance. This service is ideal for DevOps teams, ensuring faster iteration cycles, easier testing of features, and consistent production-like environments across different stages of the development lifecycle.","all"
"ARM","DevOps","Stop","FALSE","An ARM Template (Azure Resource Manager Template) is a JSON file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for Azure resources in a declarative manner. It allows users to deploy, update, or delete resources consistently and repeatedly across multiple environments. ARM templates support Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, enabling version control, automated deployment, and scalability. They can define dependencies, parameterize inputs, and handle complex resource configurations, making them ideal for managing large-scale cloud deployments.","all"
